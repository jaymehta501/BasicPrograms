Initialize result as 0 and stack with one item -1.

For i = 0, str[0] = '(', we push 0 in stack

For i = 1, str[1] = '(', we push 1 in stack

For i = 2, str[2] = ')', currently stack has [-1, 0, 1], we pop
from the stack and the stack now is [-1, 0] and length of current
valid substring becomes 2 (we get this 2 by subtracting stack top 
from current index).
Since current length is more than current result, we update result.

For i = 3, str[3] = '(', we push again, stack is [-1, 0, 3].

For i = 4, str[4] = ')', we pop from the stack, stack becomes 
[-1, 0] and length of current valid substring becomes 4 (we get 
this 4 by subtracting stack top from current index). 
Since current length is more than current result, we update result.
