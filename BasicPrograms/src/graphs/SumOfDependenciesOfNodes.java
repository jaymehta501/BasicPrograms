/**
 * Given a directed and connected graph
 * with n nodes. If there is an edge
 * from u to v then u depends on v. Our
 * task was to find out the sum of
 * dependencies for every node.
 * 
 * Answer::: Idea is to check adjacency
 * list and find how many edges are
 * there from each vertex and return the
 * total number of edges.
